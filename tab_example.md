## Example

Our last event in Logro√±o was an amazing opportunity to explain what OWASP means, the different participant share the field knowledge and we have a great moment.

In this time we have the participation as speaker Leocadio Marrero, David Reyes, Spyros, Oscar Orellana and Grant Onger, you can see the event pictures in here.

Soon we are shearing the videos of the event.
